# SASS files to be moved

Styling of items built for Angular, that be NgBootstrap or Angular components provided by FHI should not be part of the `@folkehelseinstituttet/style` package due to the need of serving projects built with React.

The files in this folder will be moved one after another when the corresponding code is made an Angular component, and placed in `/projects/fhi-angular-components/src/styles` with import accordingly.
