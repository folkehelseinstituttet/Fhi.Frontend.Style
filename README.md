# Fhi.Frontend.Style

Package containing fhi styling in both css and scss form for easy use in projects

## Usage

**NB!** This styling uses the custom font: `BrandonText` and `CrimsonText` (and fallback fonts `SourceSansPro` and `PTSerif`), which are not included in the package, and needs to be imported by the project using it.

If you want the full style library

```scss
@import "~@folkehelseinstituttet/style/scss/style.scss";
```

If you only need the variables for use in ex. a library

```scss
@import "~@folkehelseinstituttet/style/scss/variables.scss";
```
