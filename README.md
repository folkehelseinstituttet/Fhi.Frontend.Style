## Usage

**NB!** This styling uses the custom fonts `BrandonText` and `CrimsonText`, which are not included in the package, and needs to be imported by the project using it. The fallback fonts `SourceSansPro` and `PTSerif` are included.

If you want the full style library

```scss
@import "~@folkehelseinstituttet/style/scss/style.scss";
```

If you only need the variables for use in ex. a library

```scss
@import "~@folkehelseinstituttet/style/scss/variables.scss";
```
