# Fhi.Frontend.Style

Package containing fhi styling in both css and scss form for easy use in projects

## Usage

**NB!** Only `SourceSansPro` and `CrimsonText` are distributed with this package. `BrandonText` are proprietary, and needs to be imported in projects where it's a design requirement.

If you want the full style library

```scss
@import "~@folkehelseinstituttet/style/scss/style.scss";
```

If you only need the variables for use in ex. a library

```scss
@import "~@folkehelseinstituttet/style/scss/variables.scss";
```
